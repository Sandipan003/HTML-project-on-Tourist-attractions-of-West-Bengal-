        The 'Queen of Hills'</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 11pt">Darjeeling is the name of a town as well as a district in the West Bengal state of India. Both the town and the district are famous 
        as one of the most important tourist destinations in the country. Darjeeling is famous throughout the world for the tea it grows and the great view of the Kanchenjunga range of 
        mountains that it offers. It is also known for its richness in cultural & natural heritage and the famous toy train that has been declared a UN heritage. The district covering about
        1144 sq km, attracts millions of tourists every year for the variety of attractions it offers. The hill rises from the `Terai` and `Dooars` plain of Bengal and reaches an altitude of
        more than 12,000 feet. Three divisions of the district, namely Darjeeling, Kalimpong, and Kurseong constitute the hilly areas and the Siliguri subdivision is in the plains.
        To the north of the region is the Indian state of Sikkim, which borders Nepal on the West, and Bengal plains in the South and East. 
        In Darjeeling, those who grow up in the mountains identify themselves according to their ancestry: Nepalese, Bhutanese, Tibetan or Lepcha. 
        The region also contends with a religious mix - Although Hindus represent the majority, there is a strong presence of Tibetan Buddhism and other religions.
        Darjeeling Himalaya is famous for its richness of flora and fauna. There are two national parks (Neora Valley NP and Singalila NP) and one wildlife sanctuary (Mahananda WLS) in the area. 
        Singalila national park is famous for the red panda, a very rare and endangered species. Neora valley - a beautiful tropical forest, a large part of
        which is still virgin - offers a great attraction to tourists. When the British first arrived here, the place was almost completely forested and virtually uninhabited, 
        though it had once been a sizeable village. Rapid development work by the British resulted in the construction of a road in 1840, numerous houses and a sanatorium were built and a hotel opened.

      <p><font face="Tahoma" style="font-size: 11pt">The 'Queen of Hills', Darjeeling is arguably the most popular tourist destination in northeast India. Situated at an altitude of 2134m, this hill town,
        with its exquisite scenic beauty, attracts travellers of varied interests. It is the Abode of Lord Shiva and offers spectacular views of Kanchenjunga and the hospitality of colourful Himalayan people.
        Darjeeling and all her tea plantations lie under the shadow of this snowy Himalayan giant. The town is just 78 km from Siliguri (the major rail and road head) and is well connected by Bus and jeep.
