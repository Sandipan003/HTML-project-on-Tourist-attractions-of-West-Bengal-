        Mandarmani is a seaside resort village in the state of West Bengal, India, and lies in East Midnapore district, 
        at the northern end of the Bay of Bengal. It is one of the largest seaside resorts of West Bengal, fast-developing.
       </font></b><br>
      <p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><b><font face="Calibri"> It is almost 180 km from Kolkata Airport on the Kolkata - Digha route. 
       Red crabs crawling around the 13 km long beach is a special attraction of Mandarmani.
       It was argued to be the longest driveable beach in India. It is located under Contai Sub division area.
       Geomorphologically, this area has relatively low waves than nearer tourist beach of Digha. However still this beach is deposition with formation 
       of neo dunes in several areas specially around Dadanpatrabar.Initially, after its discovery, this beach was named Mandarboni and also Madar Mani. But with time it came to be known as Mandarmani.
       Mandarmani can be best reached by road, however local police currently restricts private cars to drive across the beach. A proper road has been built allowing tourists to reach their hotels from the backside.
       The nearest railway station is Contai and Ashapurna Devi railway station and the nearest airport is Kolkata.There are also multiple buses running every half-hour from 7 am till 6 pm.

       <br> The beach is the primary attraction offering tourists to enjoy the sea from early morning to late afternoon. From 3 PM onwards, people head out nearer resorts where beach bikes, ropeway etc. 
       can be availed. There are also a string of local shops selling shells, handmade jewellery and handicrafts. A few locals also offer groups to take trip towards the mohana during sunset.

       <br> Most of the resorts serve typical Bengali food and Kolkata-style Chinese cuisine. However, food is a bit costly since most of the items have to be brought from far away Kalindi/Contai market.
       The local raw materials available in the nearby village will not usually serve the requirements of the hotels or resorts. Also, do not expect very high quality food as the hotels usually employ local 
       people without much expertise as cooks. However, the food is hygienic and generally clean. Crab and prawn preperations are worth savouring. But negotiate the price beforehand.
       The  beach also has a number of small eateries which sell tea and snacks. If you want to have meals from here, you have to place an order with the owners beforehand. 
       These eateries make the food only 'on-demand' as per prior bookings from customers. With these stalls, you may have to compromise on the hygiene. Costs are again on the higher side.
       From the eateries you can borrow chairs to sit on the beach.
