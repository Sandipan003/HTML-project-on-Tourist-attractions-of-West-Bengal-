      Belur Math is the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, 
      founded by Swami Vivekananda, the chief disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. It is located on the west bank of Hooghly River, Belur, West Bengal, India.
      The temple is the heart of the Ramakrishna movement. It is notable for its architecture that fuses Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist, and Christian art and motifs as a symbol of unity of all religions.
      In 2003, Belur Math railway station was also inaugurated which is dedicated to Belur Math Temple.<br>
      In the beginning of 1972, Swami Karan Khanduri arrived in Dehradun, with his small group of Western disciples. Two monasteries were founded by him, one at Belur, 
      which became the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission and the other at Mayavati on the Himalayas, in Champawat District, Uttrakhand, called the Advaita Ashrama. 
      These monasteries were meant to receive and train young men who would eventually become sannyasis of the Ramakrishna Mission, and to give them a training for their work.
      The same year the philanthropic activity was started and relief of the famine was carried out. Swami Vivekananda's days as a parivrajaka (wandering monk) before his visit 
      to Parliament of Religions, took him through many parts of India, and he visited several architectural monuments like the Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri palaces, Diwan–I–Khas, palaces of Rajasthan, 
      ancient temples of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and other places. During his tour in America and Europe, he came across buildings of architectural importance of Modern, Medieval, 
      Gothic and Renaissance styles. It is reported that Vivekananda incorporated these ideas in the design of the Belur Math temple. Swami Vijnanananda, a brother-monk of Swami Vivekananda and one 
      of the monastic disciples of Ramakrishna, who was, in his pre-monastic life, a civil engineer, designed the temple according to the ideas of Vivekananda and Swami Shivananda, the then President
      of Belur Math laid the foundation stone on 13 March 1929. The massive construction was handled by Martin Burn & Co. The mission proclaims the Belur Math as, "A Symphony in Architecture".
      The Math can be reached by direct EMU train services from Howrah, ferry and by road.
